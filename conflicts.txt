Firstly we will pull from the branch that have merge conflict
git pull origin <branch_name>

then we will try to merge our feature branch into the that branch.
git merge <new_branch>

If there are any conflicts, Git will let you know which files are causing issues.

Then we will solve those conflict after identifying it.

Then we will push it to main branch that have conflict.
