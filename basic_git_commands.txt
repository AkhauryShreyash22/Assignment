Firstly we use 'git init' command to initialize a project.
Then we add 'git remote add <branch_name> to add a remote branch.
then we use git add . to add the changes
then we use git commit -m 'message' to commit the changes
then we use push the code to the branch with git push origin <branch_name>

I have crated a .bat file for this.
