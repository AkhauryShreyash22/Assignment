Advatages:
1: Docker ensures that the application behaves the same in development, staging, and production environments. 
2: Docker containers can run on any machine that supports Docker, regardless of the underlying operating system. This makes it simpler to deploy your MERN application across different environments (local, cloud, etc.) without worrying about platform differences.
3: Unlike virtual machines, Docker containers are lightweight because they share the host OS kernel. This results in better performance and lower resource usage, especially when deploying multiple services like MongoDB and Express.js together.
4: Docker allows for consistent and automated deployments through CI/CD pipelines. You can use Docker in your CI/CD pipeline to build, test, and deploy your MERN app in an isolated environment, ensuring that everything is properly configured and tested before reaching production.

Example:

A Company is working on project that uses Docker to containerize its MERN stack application. 
Each developer pulls the same Docker images for MongoDB, Node.js, and React, ensuring consistency across machines without manual setup. 
The development team uses Docker to run isolated services for testing new features without affecting the main app. 
In production, Docker images are deployed to cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, where containers can be quickly scaled up or down based on user demand. 
This simplifies version control and streamlines the CI/CD process for seamless updates.
